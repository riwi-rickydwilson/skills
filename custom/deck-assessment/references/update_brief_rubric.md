## Weighted Scoring Criteria (Total: 100 points)

### 1. Logic & Flow (25 points)

**Score 9-10:** Tells coherent story of progress, decisions, or risks. Clear beginning (context) → middle (situation) → end (implications/next steps). Each section flows logically into the next.

**Score 7-8:** Good logical structure with minor gaps. Most transitions are clear. Occasional jump that requires mental backfill.

**Score 5-6:** Basic organization present but flow is choppy. Sections feel more like standalone updates than integrated story. Logic requires effort to follow.

**Score 3-4:** Weak logical connection between sections. Updates feel random or sequenced by convenience rather than meaning. Story is hard to discern.

**Score 1-2:** No coherent logic or flow. Information presented without structure or connective tissue. Reader is lost.

### 2. Message Clarity (25 points)

**Score 9-10:** Key points are immediately visible. Every number or data point comes with clear implication. Headlines state conclusions, not just topics. No ambiguity about what matters.

**Score 7-8:** Main points are clear with minor digging required. Most data is contextualized. Headlines are helpful but occasionally generic.

**Score 5-6:** Messages are present but not prominent. Data shown without clear "so what?" Headlines label topics rather than communicate findings.

**Score 3-4:** Key takeaways are buried. Data dumps without interpretation. Headlines don't guide understanding. Requires significant work to extract meaning.

**Score 1-2:** Unclear what deck is communicating. Data without context. No discernible messages or conclusions.

### 3. Slide Design (15 points)

**Score 9-10:** Consistent, legible design across all slides. Clear visual hierarchy. Good use of color coding (especially for status: red/amber/green). Professional without being decorative.

**Score 7-8:** Generally consistent and readable. Minor design inconsistencies. Visual hierarchy mostly works. Adequate professionalism.

**Score 5-6:** Inconsistent design choices. Some slides cluttered or sparse. Hierarchy unclear on multiple slides. Design doesn't actively support comprehension.

**Score 3-4:** Poor design consistency. Cluttered or hard to read. Visual hierarchy confuses rather than clarifies. Unprofessional appearance.

**Score 1-2:** Design actively impedes understanding. Illegible elements, terrible color choices, or chaotic layouts.

### 4. Data & Insights (20 points)

**Score 9-10:** Every number comes with context and implication. Trends are clear. Comparisons are meaningful (vs. plan, vs. prior period, vs. target). Data tells story without excessive narration needed.

**Score 7-8:** Good use of data with clear trends. Some context missing. Most comparisons are helpful. Minor interpretation gaps.

**Score 5-6:** Data is present but underutilized. Numbers without sufficient context. Trends not highlighted. Missing key comparisons. "So what?" requires guesswork.

**Score 3-4:** Data is raw and uninterpreted. Numbers dumped without meaning. No clear trends or insights. Context is absent.

**Score 1-2:** No meaningful data or insights. Numbers are wrong, irrelevant, or completely lacking context.

### 5. Executive Readiness (15 points)

**Score 9-10:** Senior executive could grasp situation in 2 minutes. Key decisions or risks are front and center. Next steps are clear and actionable. Appropriate level of detail for audience.

**Score 7-8:** Executive could understand with moderate focus. Main points are accessible. Some context or next steps need clarification. Generally appropriate detail level.

**Score 5-6:** Executive would need explanation or supporting conversation. Key information buried or unclear. Too much or too little detail in places. Unclear what action is needed.

**Score 3-4:** Not ready for executive consumption. Requires significant context. Unclear what decisions need to be made. Poor signal-to-noise ratio.

**Score 1-2:** Would waste executive time. Incomprehensible without extensive explanation. No clear purpose or actionability.
