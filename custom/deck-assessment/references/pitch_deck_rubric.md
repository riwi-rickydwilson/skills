## Weighted Scoring Criteria (Total: 100 points)

### 1. Storyline & Narrative Flow (25 points)

**Score 9-10:** Clear problem-solution arc with tension that builds toward compelling resolution. Logical progression through: problem → solution → opportunity → validation → ask. Each slide advances the narrative purposefully.

**Score 7-8:** Solid narrative structure with minor gaps. Problem and solution are clear but transition feels mechanical. Flow is logical but lacks momentum.

**Score 5-6:** Basic structure present but narrative feels disjointed. Key elements exist but don't build on each other. Jumps between topics without clear connective tissue.

**Score 3-4:** Weak narrative structure. Problem or solution unclear. Slides feel like standalone facts rather than story progression.

**Score 1-2:** No discernible narrative. Random collection of information. Unclear what problem is being solved or why it matters.

### 2. Message Clarity (20 points)

**Score 9-10:** Every slide has one clear takeaway. Headlines are action-oriented and declarative. Complex ideas distilled to essence. No jargon without definition.

**Score 7-8:** Main messages are clear but some slides try to convey multiple points. Headlines mostly strong with occasional vagueness.

**Score 5-6:** Messages present but require effort to extract. Headlines are descriptive rather than declarative. Some unnecessary complexity.

**Score 3-4:** Unclear what many slides are trying to communicate. Headlines are generic labels. Reader must work to find the point.

**Score 1-2:** Messages are buried or absent. Headlines don't help navigation. Unclear what deck is trying to convince audience of.

### 3. Slide Design & Visual Hierarchy (15 points)

**Score 9-10:** Clean, consistent layout. Strong visual hierarchy guides the eye. Effective use of whitespace. Fonts, colors, and styling create professional polish without distraction.

**Score 7-8:** Generally clean design with minor inconsistencies. Visual hierarchy mostly clear. Some slides feel cluttered but readable.

**Score 5-6:** Inconsistent design across slides. Unclear hierarchy on some slides. Whitespace underutilized. Design doesn't actively support message.

**Score 3-4:** Cluttered or sparse in unhelpful ways. Poor contrast or readability. Inconsistent styling creates distraction.

**Score 1-2:** Design actively works against comprehension. Illegible text, clashing colors, or chaotic layouts.

### 4. Data & Evidence (20 points)

**Score 9-10:** Every claim backed by credible evidence. Data visualized clearly. Traction metrics demonstrate momentum. Proof points are relevant and impressive without overselling.

**Score 7-8:** Good use of data to support key claims. Some assertions lack backing. Metrics are present but could be more compelling or clear.

**Score 5-6:** Data present but underutilized. Charts may be unclear or misleading. Missing proof points for important claims. Evidence doesn't build confidence.

**Score 3-4:** Little meaningful data. Claims are mostly assertions. Numbers without context. Evidence feels cherry-picked or disconnected.

**Score 1-2:** No credible evidence. Unsupported claims throughout. Data is absent, irrelevant, or actively undermines credibility.

### 5. Executive Readiness (20 points)

**Score 9-10:** Boardroom-ready presentation. Professional tone throughout. Logical sequencing makes complex ideas accessible. Anticipates and addresses obvious questions. Investment ask is clear and justified.

**Score 7-8:** Professional and well-organized. Minor gaps in logic or missing context. Ask is present but could be stronger. Would work in most executive settings.

**Score 5-6:** Needs polish before executive presentation. Some logical leaps. Important context missing. Ask is unclear or poorly positioned.

**Score 3-4:** Not ready for executive audience. Significant logical gaps. Unprofessional elements. Unclear what action is being requested.

**Score 1-2:** Fundamentally unprepared for serious consideration. Major structural or logical problems. Would damage credibility in executive setting.
